# My First Blog Post

Published on: 21-09-2024

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Svelte by Zack! 
This is a demo blog post for testing the github api!
Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Svelte**: First, I created a new Svelte project.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.svelte` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have svelte markdown posts!
